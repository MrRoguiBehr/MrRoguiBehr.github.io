Hello, and welcome to my little web-page! 
I made this using Notepad, and let me tell you. 
HTML is tiring! Still, it was pretty fun to try 
out all of the little tags. Plus it's kind of cool to 
see how webpages work from the inside-out. A little bit about myself,
I'm currently a mechanical engineering major, and I'm
taking this computer science course because I really enjoy
working with computers. There's just a sort of joy in building
your own computer, using a computer that's just crazy fast,
and tinkering with all the little languages that computers
speak in. I fiddled with this code to get this text paragraph
centered for maybe an hour. I must say though, it looks a lot 
better than it would if it were just straight lines of text 
across the screen. I hope that your eyes enjoy it at least, 
because I worked hard on it. Now that our little conversation
 has gotten started, let's look at a really cute dog.

Cute dog, huh? I myself have a German Sheperd named Laika, after
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika">space dog.</a> Pretty nerdy, but hey, space and 
dogs are cool. Calling back to my mechanical engineering
degree, I want to focus on aeronautics, because let's face it, 
planes are super cool and why wouldn't you want to work on
them??? To be completely honest, however, I don't know if
I'll ever get to work on them. That's a lot of school and I
just really like building things. Maybe I'll start inventing.
Having to write out big paragraphs is really kind of difficult.
It's like having a funnel in your brain, pouring out your stream 
of consciousness. Well anyways, on the topic of dogs, here's a handy dandy little table
that will tell you my favorite dogs.

Oh! On the topic of hobbies, I love building computers, 
so much in fact that I worked for a little while doing just 
that. I also did a little work diagnosing and fixing computers, 
standard computer shop things. While I was there though, 
I wanted to streamline a few things, because I just wasn't happy
with the way things were going. Starting from knowing nothing, I
made a little batch script to help automate parts of my job. 
There was a quote I read somewhere, and it said, <p><i><b>"Assign the 
hardest tasks to those who are the laziest, because they will
find a way to get the job done in the most efficient way 
possible."</b></i></p><p align=center style="max-width:800px"> I don't think there's anything I could 
relate to more. If you want, you can take a look at the <a href
="http://m.uploadedit.com/bbtc/1516827984317.txt">batch script 
(link to .txt hosting website)</a> I made. It's nothing fancy or really special, but while
I was making it, I learned a lot and it really helped me save 
some time and frustration. And if you don't want to click on a 
sketchy link that some random student sends to you, here's a 
picture </p>
